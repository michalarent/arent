export const description = `As a software engineer, I have a strong background in both computer science and big data analysis. I have a diverse professional background, starting my career as an inside sales specialist at a start-up before transitioning to a head of sales and associate on AI consulting projects with major enterprises such as Novartis, Bailie Gifford, and Allianz at a Warsaw-based consulting agency, Sigmoidal. Currently, I am working for Sigmoidal as a software engineer on one of our core projects, Marketmove. In this role, I am responsible for developing the frontend in React/Next.js and the backend in Node, with some parts written in Rust. I work closely with the CTO to ensure the smooth operation of the project.

In addition to my professional experience, I have a strong educational background in computer science and big data analysis. I started my studies at the Warsaw School of Economics, where I specialized in big data, and later transferred to the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology to pursue a career in computer science. My education has provided me with a strong foundation in programming, data analysis, and machine learning, which have been invaluable in my professional career.
